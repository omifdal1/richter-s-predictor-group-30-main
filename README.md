**Important Notes:**

1. We saved the models after training them because they took too long (30 minutes each)to train so you can load them instead of letting them run again.

2. all the models are uploaded to git except for xgboost, it was very big

3. while running this notebook on colab, read.table at the beginning sometimes gives wrong dimensions. Please make sure you have 260601,39 as dimension of the data.
